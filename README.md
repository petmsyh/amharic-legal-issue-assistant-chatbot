# 🇪🇹 Amharic QA System using Streamlit

This project is a simple Question Answering (QA) system built for Amharic-language documents. It uses sentence-transformer embeddings and a semantic search interface powered by Streamlit.

> ✅ Ask any question in Amharic and retrieve the most relevant passages from pre-embedded legal documents.
